# A Study on the Association between Breastfeeding and Allergies in Children 5 Years Old or Younger in the United States

The association between breastfeeding and allergies remains unclear but could be mediated through breast milk’s effect on the gut’s bacterial population.

## Objective
To evaluate if breastfeeding results in a lower prevalence of allergies nationally in children 0 to 5 years old, and to determine if any association is modified as children become further removed from their last breastfeeding.

## Methods
This was a cross-sectional study using data from the 2016 National Survey of Childrens Health for children who were 5 or younger. The primary outcome was diagnosis of an allergy ever. Logistic regression was used to determine if different breastfeeding durations showed any association with presenting allergies. A second model with an interaction term between the time elapsed since last breastfed and the duration of breastfeeding tested for effect modification.

## Results
As compared to children who were never breastfed, breastfeeding for more than 12 months resulted in an increased prevalence of allergies (PR = 1.70 95% CI:1.20-2.42). Effect modification was present for children breastfeeding 6 to 12 months (p = 0.013). Children in this group that were less than one month removed from breastfeeding showed a 40% reduction in prevalence. This effect was reduced by 1.0% for each month the child was removed from its last breastfeeding.

## Conclusions
The results of this study indicate that the association between breastfeeding and allergies may change direction depending on duration. Due to the disease burden caused by allergies, the results merit further investigation under a study design that provides greater strength of evidence.
